Research $ARGUMENTS and provide comprehensive documentation to populate the current session context. Focus on:

1. Official documentation and API references
2. Current best practices and examples
3. Relevant tutorials and guides
4. Code examples and implementation patterns

Use webfetch to retrieve information from authoritative sources and organize findings clearly with direct links to documentation. The goal is to quickly establish proper context for development work.
